The system admins team of xFusionCorp Industries has set up a new tool on all app servers, as they have a requirement to create a service user account that will be used by that tool. 
They are finished with all apps except for App Server 3 in Stratos Datacenter.

Create a user named kareem in App Server 3 without a home directory.

1  useradd --help
-M, --no-create-home          do not create the user's home directory
2  useradd -M kareem               
3  cat /etc/passwd
kareem:x:1002:1002::/home/kareem:/bin/bash
4  ls /home/                 ----- user kareem should not be exist
